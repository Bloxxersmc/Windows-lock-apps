# Windows lock apps

This bat allows you to run apps on the lock screen (No webbrowsers, thats includes steam \[NOT STEAM GAMES\], and other browser based apps like disord, and youtube). Why run apps on the lock screen? Well, after you boot up your PC then you execute CMD on the lock screen than execute my program You get better performance on the apps that you put in :D. This happens because there are no background apps but the one you're running and the lockscreen.exe thing.

## Tutorial

1. open CMD as an administrator than type the following command: "cd C:\Windows\System32" also make sure you have placed the file (LOCKAPPOPENER.bat) into that directory, 
2. type "ren Utilman.exe Utilman.old" this is renameing the accesability shortcuts guy on the lockscreen so we can makeway for CMD :D, 
3. type "copy CMD.exe Utilman.exe" and that copys CMD into Utilman :D, 
4. reboot your PC and DONT TYPE THE PASSWORD instead click the accesability guy, ![Accessibility icon](https://ibb.co/Cs9fJq8m) (TODO: working link)

When you launch this new CMD type "start LOCKAPPOPERER.bat", which you have to do every time. Then, make sure you have already edited the directories in the bat file and also edited the start. If you have any questions, DM me on discord (bloxxers___)
