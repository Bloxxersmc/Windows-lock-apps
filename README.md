-why: this bat allows you to run apps on the lock screen (No webbrowsers, thats includes steam [NOT STEAM GAMES], and other browser based apps like disord, and youtube) why run apps on the lock screen? well after you boot up your PC than you somehow execute CMD on the lock screen (ILL TEACH YOU :D ) than execute my program You get better performance on the apps that you put in :D this happens because there are no background apps but the one your running and the lockscreen.exe thing :D-

tutorial: -1st step: open CMD as an administrator than type the following command: "cd C:\Windows\System32" also make sure you have placed the file (LOCKAPPOPENER.bat) into that directory-, -2nd step: type "ren Utilman.exe Utilman.old" this is renameing the accesability shortcuts guy on the lockscreen so we can makeway for CMD :D-, -3rd step: type "copy CMD.exe Utilman.exe" and that copys CMD into Utilman :D-, -4th Step: reboot your PC and DONT TYPE THE PASSWORD instead click the accesability guy, (https://ibb.co/Cs9fJq8m)-
thats just and image of where the accesability guy is :D than when you launch this new CMD type "start LOCKAPPOPERER.bat" you will have to do this everytime :C than make sure you have already edited the directorys in the bat file and also edited the start if you have any questions DM me on discord user: bloxxers___ , thanks :D
